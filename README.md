General Page Body Formatting

- (COMPLETE) All text in the page body should use the font 'Lato' at 18 pixels and 300 weight; if the 'Lato' font is not available for some reason, you should fall back to 'Helvetica Neue', then 'Helvetica', and finally sans-serif 

- (COMPLETE) The body background image is in the file background.jpg in the img directory (note that the img directory is a peer to the directory in which this CSS file lives, so you need use a relative path that goes up one level and back down into the img directory)

- (COMPLETE) The body background image size should be set so that it scales to completely cover the entire page body

- (COMPLETE) The background image should also remain fixed with regard to the viewport and not scroll with the page

- (COMPLETE) All hyperlinks (both unvisited and visited) should have no underlines, and should have the color #0000AA

- (COMPLETE) When a reader hovers over or sets focus to any hyperlink, the color should change to #0000EE

Headings

- (COMPLETE) All the headings should use the font 'Raleway' at 300 weight; use the same fall back fonts as you did for the main body font

- (COMPLETE) The top-level heading should have a font size of 300% and all margins set to 0

- (COMPLETE) The second and third-level headings should use #505050 for their font color

- (COMPLETE) The second-level headings should have a font size of 150%

- (COMPLETE) The third-level headings should have a font size of 125%

Main Page Content

- (COMPLETE) The main page content should have a Left Margin of 30% so that it is shifted over to the right side of the page by 30% of the current window width; the top, bottom, and right margins should all be 20px

- (COMPLETE) The background texture image for that area is in the file ricepaper_v3.png in the img directory

- (COMPLETE) The opacity of this area should be set to 0.9 so that is it slightly transparent

- (COMPLETE) The pizza names should use a font weight of 400. Note that different operating systems may render fonts in slightly different ways. The screen shots were taken on a Mac, so if you are viewing your page on Windows, the 400 font weight may not look quite as dark as it does in the screenshots. The TAs will be viewing these pages on a Mac and looking at your CSS source, so use 400 for the weight even if it looks a bit lighter than the screenshots on Windows.
